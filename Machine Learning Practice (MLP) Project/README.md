In this project, the primary goal was to develop predictive models capable of estimating the ratings for various recipes based on the provided dataset. This competition, hosted on Kaggle, challenged participants to explore and analyze the dataset, leveraging their machine learning and data analysis skills to achieve the highest prediction accuracy. The final submission Notebook - [21f3000007-notebook-t12024.ipynb](https://github.com/tushar-mahalya/IITM-Capstone-Projects/blob/root/Machine%20Learning%20Practice%20(MLP)%20Project/21f3000007-notebook-t12024.ipynb) contains the following information -
- Project Discription

## Note
1. Given GitHub's limitations in rendering Jupyter notebooks accurately, it is advisable to utilize the provided buttons for accessing and opening the notebook, particularly for viewing the HTML contents for showcasing final modeling pipeline. This will ensure a more seamless experience and accurate representation of the notebook's contents.
2. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I couldn't incorporate the last-minute changes into the model pipeline. As a result of utilizing multi-seed inference, the outcomes presented in the final notebook may vary. Therefore, it's important to recognize that these results are not definitive and absolute.
